# HTTP API

RavenFS provides an HTTP API for managing file system via HTTP requests. It makes an access to the Raven file system client platform independently. The offered client APIs (C# API and HTTP) provide the same functionality.

The documentation contained in this chapter explains how to use this HTTP API to communicate with RavenFS server. Examples show how to create appropriate requests and responses returned by the server. To create requests cURL tool has been used. More details about cURL can be found at: [http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manual.html](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manual.html).
